 *       at the same moment, which is what the database takes atomically.
 * Note: What the code grants is decided again from the very use which was taken rather than from the preview the
 *       browser was shown, so a code which stopped covering the whole membership meanwhile gives nothing away.
 * Note: A use which was taken for a membership that is then refused or cannot be written is lost. That is deliberate:
 *       spending one use of a code is a far smaller thing than giving away a membership nobody may have.
